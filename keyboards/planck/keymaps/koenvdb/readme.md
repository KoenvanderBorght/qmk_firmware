# My own take on the Planck layout
The things that stand out in this layout:

    1. Focused on Windows
    2. Lot of similarities to the default ergodox layout
    3. Create, close and moving to other desktops in Windows 10
    4. Tap dance keys for several keys, mainly in the programming layer
        * In the number row, tap once for the number, twice for the symbol
        * The {} keys when tapped once, [] when tapped twice
        * - when tapped once, _ when tapped twice
        * Tap once for next song, tap twice for previous
        * Tap once to copy, twice to paste
    5. Mouse controls in the Raise layer
        * On the left side, mouse navigation
        * On the right side, scrolling and acceleration
    6. Arrow keys on the Lower layer
        * Arrow keys on IJKL
        * Home, End, PageUp, PageDn, Ins, PSCR around the arrows
